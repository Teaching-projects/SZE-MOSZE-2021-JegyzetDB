Please install this plugin which automatically migrates data and settings from `Adrenth.Redirect`. The current version of `Adrenth.Redirect` will stay available for users which have it installed, but will be hidden from the October CMS marketplace. Upgrade to `Vdlp.Redirect` as soon as possible.

## The #1 Redirect plugin for October CMS

This is the best Redirect-plugin for October CMS. With this plugin installed you can manage redirects directly from October CMS' beautiful interface. Many webmasters and SEO specialists use redirects to optimise their website for search engines. This plugin allows you to manage such redirects with a nice and user-friendly interface.

## History

This plugin was originally build in 2016 by Alwin Drenth a Software Engineer at Van der Let & Partners.
As of 2018 this plugin is re-distributed to the October CMS Marketplace with vendor name Vdlp.Redirect (formerly known as Adrenth.Redirect).

The Redirect plugin will now be maintained by Van der Let & Partners and You (the open source community).

## Performance

All redirects are stored in the database and will be automatically "published" to a file which the internal redirect mechanism uses to determine if a certain request needs to be redirected. This is way faster than querying a database.

This plugin is designed to be fast and should have no negative effect on the performance of your website.

To gain maximum performance with this plugin:

* Enable redirect caching using a "in-memory" caching method (see Caching).
* Maintain your redirects frequently to keep the number of redirects as low as possible.
* Try to use placeholders to keep your number of redirect low (less redirects is better performance).

## Caching

If your website has a lot of redirects it is recommended to enable redirect caching. You can enable redirect caching in the settings panel of this plugin.

Only cache drivers which support tagged cache are supported. So driver `file` and `database` are not supported. For this plugin database and file caching do not increase performance, but can actually have a negative influence on performance. So it is recommended to use an in-memory caching solution like `memcached` or `redis`.

### How caching works

If caching is enabled (and supported) every request which is handled by this plugin will be cached. It will be stored with tag `Vdlp.Redirect`.

When you modify a redirect all redirect cache will be invalidated automatically. It is also possible to manually clear the cache using the 'Clear cache' button in the Backend.

## Placeholders

This plugin makes advantage of the `symfony/routing` package. So if you need more info on how to make placeholder requirements for your redirection URLs, please go to: https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing/introduction.html#usage
